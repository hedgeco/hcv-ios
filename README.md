## Summary

This is the first prototype of the native iOS client. It communicates directly with the hcv-api middleware for authentication, model data, account performance, etc. (no reliance on the Drupal site)

No functionality for allocations yet, but it handles the users watchlist and accounts, and also has the beginning of a neat "model marketplace" view.
