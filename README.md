## Summary

This is the first prototype of the native iOS client. It communicates directly with the hcv-api middleware for authentication, model data, account performance, etc. (no reliance on the Drupal site). I've built the views to allow pre-population with middleware data, but have not yet built in support for the real-time socket data.

No functionality for allocations yet, but it handles the users watchlist and accounts, and also has the beginning of a neat "model marketplace" view.
